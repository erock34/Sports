Game of the Week App

This app features the game of the week for the football league.  This game is amongst the two top rated teams in the league, at the current week.

The home page features the two teams with both of their helmets at the top.  The user can access each teams information by clicking on each helmet or using the drawer app to the left.

The user can also select which team they think is going to win by clicking on the YOUR PICK button.
This will take you to a page where you can select the team that is going to win.   Click on the SUBMIT button and that will take the user to the page that will show them who they voted for in the vote.

Each teams home page includes three items.  They are tabs for Team Information, Schedule, and Team Roster.

The Team Information page includes contact information for each team.

The Schedule page includes the upcoming games for each team and the option to purchase tickets.  The ticket page allows the user to pick the amount of tickets and the option to purchase parking.  The user can then click on the SUBMIT button, which will take them to a screen to show the total price.

The Team Roster page will take you to the position page.  The user then can select on the position, (ie. Running backs) and will take the user to the name of that player at that position.
